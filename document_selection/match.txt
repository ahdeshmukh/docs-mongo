Match operator ($match) is good for performance. MongoDB aggregation is done in memory and would fail if the memory consumption reaches 10%. Using $match we can reduce the result set by filtering the unwanted data, which will help in improving the processing.

$match is a pipeline operator. So unlike the find command, it can be used multiple times in the pipeline before or after other pileline operators. 

eg: Find all animals with tag water
db.animals.aggregate({$match:{tags:'water'}})

Compound match is like a logical AND
eg: Find animals with tag water and info.type bird
db.animals.aggregate({$match:{"tags":'water', "info.type":'bird'}})
